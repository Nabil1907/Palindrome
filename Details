    Considerations:
        The algorithm preprocesses the input string by converting it to lowercase and removing spaces and punctuation.
        This approach ensures that the algorithm is case-insensitive and ignores spaces and punctuation.
        Special characters and spaces are removed to handle cases where only alphanumeric characters matter in the palindrome check.

    Whiteboard Demonstration:
        Explain the pseudocode step by step, emphasizing the importance of preprocessing to ensure a fair comparison.
        Illustrate the steps using an example, showing how the string "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" becomes "amanaplanacanalpanama" after preprocessing.

    Algorithm Complexity:
        Time Complexity: O(n) - where n is the length of the input string.
            Preprocessing takes O(n) time as each character needs to be examined.
            Checking if the processed string is a palindrome also takes O(n) time.
        Space Complexity: O(n) - additional space is used for the processed string.

    Alternative Solutions:
        Two-Pointer Approach:
            Instead of creating a reversed string, use two pointers to compare characters from the beginning and end.
            This reduces space complexity to O(1) but doesn't affect time complexity significantly.
        Recursive Approach:
            Divide the string into halves and compare corresponding characters recursively.
            Similar time and space complexity, might be less intuitive for some.
        Using Built-in Functions:
            Depending on the programming language, there might be built-in functions (e.g., Python's str.lower() and str.isalnum()) that simplify the code but don't significantly change the complexity.
